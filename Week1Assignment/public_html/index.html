                            algorithms, languages, operating systems, communications, computer networks, artificial intelligence 
                            and the theoretical foundations of computation. 
                            By studying this module, students will gain a sound theoretical and practical grounding 
                            on which to build their understanding of future technical developments.</p>
                        <p>This module analyses the dynamics of Computer Science by reviewing topics in an historical perspective, 
                            while challenging the participants to monitor their possible future

                            required to generate well- structured object-oriented programs in Java. The module also explores important 
                            techniques (such as distributed systems and component technology) that have made object-oriented programming todayâ€™s 
                            predominant software development paradigm.</p>

                            software development and maintenance. It covers identification, definition, design, analysis, verification and management of basic requirements, 
                            coding, testing, evaluation and quality assurance. You will emerge from this module equipped to lead a programming project and deliver 
                            products on time and within budget.</p>
                        <p>This course provides the theoretical foundation concerning software approaches and provides exposure to the development, implementation and maintenance of the product. 
                            The primary goal is to introduce students to the discipline of Software Engineering.</p>

                            With database technology developing rapidly, this module analyses the ways in which data is stored, manipulated, queried (with an emphasis on relational databases)
                            and backed up. While studying this module, you will also become acquainted with various paradigms and technologies (parallel as well as distributed) 
                            related to database design, implementation and maintenance.</p>
                        <ul><li>To provide students with a critical understanding of the design and realisation of relational database systems</li>
                            <li>To provide students with an in depth understanding of the operation (storage, manipulation, querying) of relational databases</li>

                            To function effectively, professional IT practitioners need not only the appropriate technical knowledge, skills and experience, 
                            but also a broad understanding of the context in which they operate. IT professionals must understand the relationship 
                            between technological change, society and the law, and the powerful role that computers and computer professionals play in a 
                            technological society. This module helps IT professionals to be capable in their chosen professional areas, operate effectively 
                            in work and community situations and to be aware of their environments.</p>
